	Explanaition of the epsilon greedy algorythm
"""

In reinforcement learning we either explore, wich is look for options for the system 
to feed us or exploit wich implies to use the best known option at that time.

The epsilon greedy algorythm ensures that we get a desiered rate between 
the times we explore against the times we exploit.

---------- Pseudo Code ----------

epsilon_greedy = 10 or 5 tipicaly
r = random
if epsilon_greedy > r
	exploit
else
	explore
